#Comparison studies to other image detection schemes

In this directory we store the output of running our
test images through other image detection schemes, such as Googlenet, etc.
This is to see how our work stacks up against more general image
recognition schemes.

##Googlenet
The files starting with googlenet- were the result of running a googlenet test on our test images.
