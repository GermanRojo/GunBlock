The following are the image directories used for the project.

These four are the images provided by the individual team members:
./images-edwardo
./images-german
./images-oscar
./images-gunter

The master image directory is "images". Images are moved into this directory
only after they have annotated and the annotations have been merged
into the master annotation (JSON) file.
